            From day to night in Uummannaq, West Greenland.
          </b>
          Exploring the frozen sea ice landscape around the island by dogsled
           really made me feel the remoteness of this area. We had heard of a
            towering iceberg far out in the fjord, but the mission to reach it
             left us fighting for time to make it back before a storm hit the
              area. We almost made it when the wind began to warn us of what’s
               coming, so we turned back. Luckily I could send the drone the
                rest of the way to photograph the towers.

                When the weather eventually rolled in,
                it was so intense we stayed inside for
                  a couple of days. The Arctic is full
                  of challenges and surprises, you just
                    have to work with the conditions you
                    are given by nature and let the story
                      play out in its own way.

            Cruising on the Gentoo penguin highway.
          </b>
          One of the most memorable parts of exploring the Antarctic 
          peninsula is seeing (and smelling) the penguin rookeries
           scattered around the landscape.

          The gentoos often create these paths through the ice which
           all of them tend to follow. It doesn’t go down well
           when one decides to stop

        An encounter I’ll never forget.
       </b>
       We came across this male Polar Bear on the north coast of Svalbard,
        climbing down from the snowy cliffs to reach a whale carcass on the shoreline.

       I remember the water being so clear that we could see the whale
        bones on the sea floor. This bear seemed to be diving down to grab
         the bones, which was a surreal sight from the zodiacs.

            Textures of the Reykjanes peninsula.
          </b>
          Today, a very short-lived eruption began in Sundhnúkagígar,
           just north of the town Grindavík. The activity stopped after
            just a few hours, and there have since been earthquakes felt
             around the peninsula. The magma is on the move, a sign of
              just how alive nature is here.
