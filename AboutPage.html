        Forging a career as a photographer, filmmaker and field guide after beginning
         to travel around Iceland and later moving from his home in Australia in 2015,
          Benjamin's core focus is to tell deeper visual stories of nature in the Arctic
           and sub-Arctic, both as a traveller and a local.

                The progression of exploring Iceland has slowly shifted
 over the years from the coastline to the most remote regions
  of the highlands. His photographs are driven by the pursuit
   to immerse deeper into nature and return to the same locations
    throughout the year to better understand the visual changes
     that each season brings. Moving deeper into the polar regions,
      Benjamin has carried out multiple natural history assignments
       and worked as a photography guide since 2017 in Svalbard,
        Greenland and Antarctica.
